Variables - it's just like empty bottles that you can fill what you want, and if you fill something on it give them label, just imagine if an iodize salt and refined sugar was in the same bottle? are they can be usable? of course not, so we can put them into empty battle and give them label so we can use it for what we want to use it. just like variables.
Strings - for me this is like giving names to a person, so that we didnt call them "Hey! you person!" so we can call them as their names. just like variable to string.
Functions (arguments, `return`) - this is like a group of people that every person have their own task to manage and if someone not to perform their task, the operation will stop.
if statement - this is like a mathematical formula by answering yes and no with explanation.
Boolean values (`true`, `false`) - The options by answering if statement. Their will be no hang answered. it will be answered and explained by boolean.
